Yes! If it's important for your company to keep everything on your own local
network, read our [CodeStream On-Prem
documentation](https://docs.codestream.com/onprem/) to learn more about the
offering. You can be up and running in just minutes!

### Does your company already have a CodeStream On-Prem installation?

If you received an invitation to join a CodeStream team, simply click on the
"Join an existing team" button after installing the CodeStream extension in your
IDE, and then paste in the invitation code you received. Your company's
CodeStream server URL is baked into that code and we'll automatically add it to
your CodeStream extension settings so that you are pointing at your company's
on-prem installation and not our cloud service.

If you weren't invited, and instead want to create a CodeStream team of your
own, you'll need to first [set your server URL in the CodeStream extension
settings.](https://docs.codestream.com/onprem/ide/overview/)
