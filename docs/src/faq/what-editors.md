title: What IDEs/editors are supported?
description: 
---

CodeStream is currently available for [VS
Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeStream.codestream),
[Visual
Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeStream.codestream-vs),
[JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12206-codestream), and
[Atom](https://atom.io/packages/codestream), but support is on the way for
Eclipse, Sublime and others.

### What if I don't use a supported editor?

Not to worry! There are a couple of ways you can still participate in CodeStream
discussions with the rest of your team.

* **Email Notifications** - By default, you’ll receive email notifications for
  discussions where you’re mentioned, and you can even reply to the email and
  your reply will get posted to CodeStream.
* **Slack Sharing** - Discussions can optionally be shared out to channels and
  direct messages on Slack, and teammates can add replies directly from Slack.
  If one or more people on your team use an IDE that isn’t supported by
  CodeStream, you may want to make it policy to have discussions shared to Slack
  whenever possible.
