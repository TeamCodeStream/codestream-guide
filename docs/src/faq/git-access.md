title: What access to my GIT hosting service do you require?

You won’t need to provide CodeStream with any Git (or GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.)
credentials, as the extension simply leverages your IDE’s access to Git.
CodeStream uses Git to do things like automatically mention the most recent
author when you share a block of code in a post, and to maintain the connection
between that block of code and where it’s located in the source file as the file
evolves over time (and commits).
