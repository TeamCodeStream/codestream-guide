title: Do you store my source code on your servers?
description:
---
When you create a codemark, that is, a discussion connected to a block of code,
that specific block of code is stored on CodeStream's servers. CodeStream,
however, does not require direct access to your source tree and does not store
copies of any code beyond the specific snippets being discussed.

If your company requires that all code discussions and code snippets remain on
your network, CodeStream does offer an [on-premises
solution](https://github.com/TeamCodeStream/onprem-install/wiki) in addition to
the cloud service.
