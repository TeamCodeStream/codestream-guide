title: Do you store my source code on your servers?
description:
---
When you create a comment or issue connected to a block of code, that specific
block of code is stored on CodeStream's servers. In the case of feedback
requests, the information required to reconstruct the changeset diffs is also
stored on our servers. This may or may not include source code, depending on
whether or not the feedback request includes changes that have not been pushed.

If your company requires that all code discussions and code snippets remain on
your network, CodeStream does offer an <a href="https://docs.codestream.com/onprem/">on-premises
solution</a> in addition to the cloud service.
