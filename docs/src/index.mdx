## Quick Start

Use the navigation to the left to jump straight to any topic. Otherwise, read on
to get started with CodeStream in just four easy steps.

### 1. Install the CodeStream extension in your IDE and sign up.

Install CodeStream for [VS
Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeStream.codestream),
[Visual
Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeStream.codestream-vs),
[JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12206-codestream) or
[Atom](https://atom.io/packages/codestream). The CodeStream pane should
automatically appear at the right side of your editor. Click on "Create a team"
if you are the first person from your team to join CodeStream, or click on "Join
an existing team" if you received an invitation code via email.

### 2. Connect your issue-tracking service to CodeStream

Whether your team uses Jira, Trello, GitHub or another service to track your
tasks, just head to the Tasks tab and connect CodeStream to your issue tracking
service so that you can select a ticket, update its status, create a feature
branch, and get to work!

### 3. Discuss code just like commenting on a Google doc

Whether you're trying to understand someone else's code or getting help with
some code you just wrote, just select the code and ask your question.

### 4. Request and perform code reviews right inside your IDE

Select "Request a code review" from the blue "+" menu at any time in the
development cycle, whether it’s a quick look over some work in progress (even
uncommitted code!) or a formal review of a completed effort.

Teammates can do the review right in their IDE, with no need to switch branches
or set aside their own work. [Learn more about in-IDE code
reviews.](../gettingStarted/code-review)

### 5. Invite your teammates and get a “live view” into their work-in-progress

You'll want some teammates on board so that you have people to discuss and
review code.

CodeStream's "live view" increases team transparency and even let's you know
about potential merge conflicts before they actually happen! [Learn more about
team "live view".](../features/team-live-view)
