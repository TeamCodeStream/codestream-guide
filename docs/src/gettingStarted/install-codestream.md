## System & Configuration Requirements

While technically not a requirement, key elements of CodeStream’s functionality
depend on your repository being managed by Git, or a Git hosting service like
GitHub. If you’re not using Git, CodeStream will not be able to connect the
codemarks you create to the appropriate blocks of code in your source files.

## Installing the CodeStream Extension

Install CodeStream for [VS
Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeStream.codestream),
[Visual
Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeStream.codestream-vs),
[JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12206-codestream) or
[Atom](https://atom.io/packages/codestream). Support for more editors is on the
way.

Once you've installed the extension, the CodeStream pane should automatically
appear in the sidebar for VS Code, or in a tool window at the right side for a
JetBrains IDE or Visual Studio. If for some reason it doesn't, simply click on
the CodeStream entry in your IDE's status bar.

Now that you’ve got the plugin up and running, you’re ready to sign up and
create a team!
