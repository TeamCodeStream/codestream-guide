## System & Configuration Requirements

The code you would like to discuss and review on CodeStream must be in a
repository being managed by Git, or a Git hosting service like GitHub.

## Installing the CodeStream Extension

Install CodeStream for [VS
Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeStream.codestream),
[Visual
Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeStream.codestream-vs) or
[JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12206-codestream).

Once you've installed the extension, the CodeStream pane should automatically
appear in the sidebar for VS Code, or in a tool window at the right side for a
JetBrains IDE or Visual Studio. If for some reason it doesn't, simply click on
the CodeStream entry in your IDE's status bar.

Now that you’ve got the plugin up and running, you’re ready to sign up!
