The Work In Progress section is a snapshot of the local changes you have in
flight in your IDE, as well as the associated ticket from your issue tracking
service.

All repositories you have open in your IDE are listed, and if you have any local
(i.e, unpushed) changes in any of them you can expand that section to see the
list of changed files. Click on any file name to view a diff of your changes so
far, or click on the icon that appears at the end of the row to open your the
file itself. Also look out for the file names in orange as they represent
potential merge conflicts. Hover over the file name to see which teammate you
need to coordinate with to avoid a conflict.

The icons to at the end of each repository's row allow you to quickly create a
feedback request or a pull request. Remember that you donâ€™t need to wait until
the work is completed to request feedback. 

What you see in the Work in Progress section is, by default, also shared with
your teammates in the [My Team section](myteam-section). You can, however, click
the icon in this section's heading to turn off sharing.
