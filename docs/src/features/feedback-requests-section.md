The Feedback Requests section of the CodeStream pane lists all open feedback
requests that have been assigned to you, or that you have requested.

Click on a request to jump in and start reviewing, or to see your teammate’s
comments on your work.

When you hover over the Pull Requests section heading, you'll see a "+" icon to
create a new feedback request. If you're a team admin you'll also see a gear
icon to control how both feedback request assignments and approvals work for
your team.

By default, the person requesting feedback can decide how approvals work, but
you can, instead, set a default behavior for all feedback requests for the team.

* Any reviewer can approve - Any one can approve the feedback request,
  regardless of how many reviewers are assigned.
* All reviewers must approve individually - Each assigned reviewer must
  individually approve the feedback request before it’s considered approved.

You can also decide if and how CodeStream suggests reviewers. Round-robin will
cycle through all developers on the team. Random will randomly assign the
feedback request to any developer on the team. The Authorship options will
suggest up to three reviewers based on the developers who wrote the lines of
code impacted by the changes, as well as other developers who may have committed
to the branch.
