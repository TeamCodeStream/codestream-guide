## Permalinks for Sharing Anywhere

CodeStream has built-in mechanisms for sharing to Slack, Microsoft Teams, or
issue-tracking services, like Jira, Trello, etc., but you can also grab the link
for any comment, issue or feedback request to share it elsewhere. An existing
Jira ticket. A wiki. A thread in your messaging service. Whatever the case may
be, just look for the “Copy link” option under the ellipses menu.

Whenever someone clicks on the link, after authenticating with CodeStream
they'll automatically be redirected through the web to their IDE, where the
discussion will automatically be opened. In the case of a comment or issue, the
source file will also be opened and scrolled to the corresponding block of code.

CodeStream does its best to determine which IDE to open, largley based on the
IDE that you last used to access CodeStream. However, you can always return to
the web page that was opened and select any IDE. Your selection will be
remembered for the next time you attempt to open a discussion associated with
the same repository.

Note that if you’re using a JetBrains IDE you’ll need to first install the
[Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/) so that CodeStream can
deep link into the IDE.

## Permalinks for Code Blocks

Sometimes you don’t necessarily want to comment on a block of code, but instead
just want to easily share the code with a teammate. CodeStream's permalinks are
"living" links that will always point to the code in question, even if it's
moved to a different location in the file.

Select the code in your editor and then click the button to get a permalink for
that code.

Decide whether you want the permalink to be public or private, with private
permalinks requiring CodeStream authentication before the code can be viewed.

Copy your permalink and paste anywhere you'd like to share the block of code.

Just like with comments, issues and feedback requests, whenever someone clicks
on the permalink they'll automatically be redirected through the web to their
IDE, where the source file will be opened and scrolled to the corresponding
block of code.
