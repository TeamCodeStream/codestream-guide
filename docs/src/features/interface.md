The CodeStream interface surfaces all the items you need to see, and do, in a
customizable tree-based view that is always available.

Subsequent articles will go into more detail on each section, but here's a quick
overview.

* [Pull Requests](pull-requests-section) - If your team uses GitHub or GitHub
  Enterprise to host your code, you'll see all of your open pull requests listed
  and you can just click on one to edit it or perform a review.
* [Feedback Requests](feedback-requests-section) - Any open feedback requests
  either assigned to you or requested by you are listed.
* [Codemarks](codemarks-section) - Whether they originated in a pull request, a
  feedback request, or through ad-hoc code comments/issues, "codemarks" are the
  discussions that annotate your codebase and all of the codemarks in the
  currently selected file are listed for reference.
* [Work in Progress](wip-section) - A summary of your local changes, by repo, as
  well the issue you're currently working on.
* [Issues](issues-section) - See all of your open issues, across multiple
  services, in one place, and click on one to update its status, create a
  feature branch to do your work, and even update your status on Slack.
* [My Team](team-live-view) - See who is on your CodeStream team, as well as
  what they're working on, and invite new members.

The CodeStream pane is completely customizeable. Use drag-and-drop to reorder
the sections. Resize each one individually. Expand or collapse a section as
needed. There's also an option to maximize a section when you want to get a good
view of a longer list.

If there's a section you don't think you'll be using, you can hide it via the
View menu by clicking on your headshot at the top of the CodeStream pane.

At the top-right of the CodeStream pane you'll find access to some options for
creating and discovering content in your team.

  changes, or to create a pull request.
* [Activity Feed](activity-feed) - The Activity Feed will let you know about new
  code comments/issues and feedback requests, as well as replies to existing
  ones.
* [Filter & Search](filter-and-search) - Filter & Search allows you to slice and
  dice your teamâ€™s collection of code comments/issues and feature requests
  however you see fit.

And lastly, at the top-left of the CodeStream pane, click on your headshot for
options related to [account settings](account-settings) and [team
