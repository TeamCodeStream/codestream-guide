# CodeStream User Guide

This repo is dedicated to the CodeStream User Guide which is one in a series of
similar docs sites across the CodeStream ecosystem.

This site is statically generated with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) using
themes created by the engineers of the [Apollo Data Graph
Platform](https://www.apollographql.com). These themes depend, in part, on
[Space Kit](https://space-kit.netlify.app).

Gatsby is built on top of Node and React.

This site utilizes markdown and MDX for much of its content.
